Over four years, I developed custom components and implemented complex logic across the app, navigating multiple redesigns and ensuring functionality across varied app flows. I built and integrated REST APIs, managed data pipelines, and maintained microservices. In 2024, our team migrated the app to Next.js, refactoring legacy code from Web Components with a focus on scalability and future-proofing.",
