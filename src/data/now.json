We eat as a family, and the goal has always been to cook one meal for everyone. 101 Before One really helped make this feasible for us, and we still use their recipes and guidance even well past our kiddo's 1 year mark."

To that end, I'm perusing job openings in this tough job-seekers market, practicing skills by creating, and studying things I may be interviewed on but have never had to use professionally (traditional data structures an algorithms)."

In our yard, getting ready for winter largely entails leaving things as they are - all sorts of beneficial birds and bugs depend on dead flower stalks and leaf cover to survive the winter or plant eggs in."
